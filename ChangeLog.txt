Dev/Mapper notes:
- More decorate stuff for mappers:
   - Zombie corpses (Sprites, thanks to ZioMccall)
   - Bottles, shotglass, meteorite piece, nazi flag stand, gramaphone, decaying corpse, brainjar (Thanks to MrEnchanter)
   - Hanging soldier (Thanks to TankDemspey)
   - Grass
   - Teleporter pad, pack a punch, perk machines (Thanks to NZ:P Team)
- Fixed the cluttered mess that was NZDE0.8.PK3:
   - Actors, Sprites and Textures are now organized in files (Organizing textures, thanks to MrEnchanter)
   - Decorate lump has tags for finding things easier using Ctrl+F
   - Renamed a few other actor lumps
- Added a ton of new textures (Including wallitem textures) (Thanks to MrEnchanter and WhiteAce)
- Removed Titlepic stuff (was unused and I don't think there would be a use for it now)
- Because weapons are now undroppable, due to this you should probably remove Colt45 at the start of the round in the scripts, should you use an alt weapon otherwise it'll stay in players inventory
- Had to change Specialgrenades names to SpecGrenades, it was causing issues with Zandro 3.0 and GZDoom
- Added several scripts, both WIP and scripts within the maps to acssource folder within the PK3, makes it easier for me to find out which code is the latest
   - This includes the pack a punch code
